/**
 * An LDP/Solid Container corresponding to a directory on the FileSystem.
 *
 * Because we are typing the actor, we need to check before creation what the type of the actor 
 * created is!! The main difference between a directory and a file is that a directory can route
 * messages to subdirectores (hence `Route`` and `Do`). The directory is in a good position 
 * to know its contents. 
 *
 * If the next message is a `Route` then depending on the action
 * - PUT: must create the container
 * - GET, POST, DELETE: must be sent to another container
 *
 * If the next message is a `Do` then it needs to check
 * * If the URL ends in `/` the next actor must be mapped to a directory
 * * Otherwise the container needs to look at the mime type and calculate the resource
 * e.g. `cat` with mime type `image/jpg` goes to `cat.jpg`
 * e.g. `cat.jpg` with mimte type `image/jpg` got to `cat.jpg`
 * e.g. `cat.exe` with mime type `image/jpg` goes to `cat.exe$.jpg`
 * * POST must create a new name for the resource if it already exists and forward that to the actor
 * * GET, PUT, ... can create the resource actor which will then copy the content to disk or serve it
 *
 * Note: because actors have unique names, the container only needs to create the actor and forward the message.
 * It does not need to block on saving to disk, or creating the file. 
 *
 * If we did not type the actor then the container could for GET just create the actor,  which could
 * check its existence. 
 *
 * Note, the container may need to read some config files on startup, so it will need to
 * check its own existence in any case.
 *
 * It is the Container's role to 
 *  - name new resources on a POST, and check with the Guard they can be created
 *  - on a PUT with intermediary dirs it can create the subactor, which will create the resource,
 *    this works because actors have unique names.  But the container needs to check with its Guard 
 *    before doing that.
 *  - on DELETE it needs to check with the container and the actor
 *  - route messages for GET onto subactors (which have a guard?) 
 *  - for DIRS these get passed along 
 *  - for files these get passed along 
 *  - PATCH is like PUT
 *   - QUERY is like GET
 * */

/**
 * Class of Resource objects, mapped to a path on the file system.
 * Our convetion for files on the FS at present (later to be modularized) is designed
 * to avoid needing to load the container contents into memory, and to allow content negotiation
 * to work both locally and on the file system. These are the rules:
 *  1. The root of the file is the string up to the first "." (same with directories)
 *  1. All roots have a symbolic link to the original resource. So if `cat.raw` is a large picture loaded first
 *     then `cat` is a symbolic link to `cat.raw`. Later the resource actor can keep copies of other versions
 *     for other devices such as smart phones, but link will keep track of which is the original file.
 *  1. Requests for `cat.jpg` are passed to the `cat` child actor that can deal with content negotiation for that
 *    resource
 *  1. Languagee based content negotiation (not implemented) would on a request for `blog` search for `blog.en.html`
 *  1. The file pointed to by the symlink will contain metadata (perhaps extended attributes) informing the server of other versions.
 *  1. The directory will contain xattrs of its own:
 *    - one of these will be set after the actor has gone through the directory to set all the symlinks, so it knows
 *      that it need not do it again
 *    - others?
 *  1. To be able to deal with Multiple Posts of content with the same Slug (Eg. If a POST with `Slug: My Blog`
 *     is posted 3 times) the container needs to know what the next version is without having to download the whole dir.
 *     We can add metadata for a symlink so that the container can know that the next name should be MyBlog_4,
 *     without needing to search for MyBlog_1`, `MyBlog_2` and `MyBlog_3`
 *     This avoids having to create ugly hash based file names.
 *  1. alternatively instead of using xattrs every root could come with a `x.meta.ttl` that contains the file
 *     meta-data
 *  1. If a resource `cat` is deleted the actor will create a `cat.archive` directory and move all associatd files there.
 *     (this is to be able to recover from a problem half way through deleting.)
 *     The `cat` link is removed and a new one created to the archive directory. This will allow us to enforce a memory
 *     that a file is no longer available. Better methods of doing this could be possible.
 *
 *  Some Advantages:
 *
 *  - The symbolic link trick allows Content Negotiation to  work correctly when files are edited on the FS direectly,
 *  since links with relative URLs in one document to the root name of a file, can be viewed locally as if they
 *  were Negotiated by local editors, since they can find the file by following the symbolic link.
 *  - It also helps a lot for RDF formats: If the first version uploaded is `card.ttl` then `card` will link to `card.ttl`
 *  and that file can be the one updated on PATCH or PUT.
 *  - We want to make Content Negotiation work right out of the box, so as to avoid changes in format preferences
 *    (such as a move from ttl to json-ld or vice versa, breaking all the links)
 *  - There are important speed advantage to be had, by using xattrs as that avoids walking the whole directory
 *     - an actor only needs to check if the root of the file (e.g. `blog`) exists, which is one call to the FS. If the file exists, then the Container can start the child actor, and later pass on calls to it
 *     - The child actor can retrieve the Xattrs from the original file, to find out where the variants are.
 *     Otherwise the Containere would need to load the whole directory contents in memory, which could be slow if too many
 *     files are listed there, and the result would uses up a lot of memory. (this may be negligeable for a few directores,
 *     but could become problematic for a large number of open ones).
 *
 *  Notes:
 *    - the actor could load the full dir data into memory on a container that is heavily used when needed.
 *    - ideally the attributes should be mapped to the files, so that it should be possible to recover them by
 *      running through the files
 *
 * @param containerUrl the URL of the container. (without the slash, so that it is east to write `ctnr / path`)
 * @param dirPath      the path on the filesystem that corresponds to the container
